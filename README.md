# odin-recipes

One of my very first HTML projects.

Using Basic HTML I have built this webpage which consist of a landing page
that holds easy to ready links to a series of recipes. 

Through this project i have demonstrated:
	*creating a repo and moving it to my local machine
	*appropriate use of file navigation
	*importance of headers
	*how to link files and web pages
